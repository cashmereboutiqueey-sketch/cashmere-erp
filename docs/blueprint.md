## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Gold (#CFB53B) to evoke luxury and sophistication, complementing the brand name. Gold avoids the commonality of green in ERP systems, aligning with high-end fashion. 
- Background color: Off-white (#FAF9F6), a desaturated gold hue, offering a subtle backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain, especially in data-heavy interfaces. The decision to use an off-white as the background creates a softer interface that balances usability with high-end fashion cues.
- Accent color: Charcoal Gray (#36454F) to provide a sophisticated contrast for interactive elements, CTAs, and crucial data points. It enhances user engagement and ensures clear visibility of key functions within the application.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font, provides an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel.
- Use minimalist icons, in a 'linear' style, that fit the overall aesthetic.
- Employ a clean, modern layout with a sidebar navigation for easy access to different modules and features. Focus on creating intuitive workflows to improve user efficiency and reduce the learning curve.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user engagement, such as loading animations or progress indicators. The animations should be kept short, clean, and relevant.
